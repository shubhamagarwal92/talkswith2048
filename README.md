# Talks with 2048

[![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/vipulgupta2048/talkswith2048) [![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.png?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

### About 2048 

_This repository acts as a showcase... of just about everything I loved doing in my college years (Thankfully, I ain't done yet) It's a gauge I keep for progress and personal development._

I love to giving back to the open-source community in whatever way I can. Hence, all the resources used in those talks are kept open-source and public for anyone to use and view in whatever capacity they see fit. Adding on to it, this repository is also a tracker of conferences that I attended/was invited/volunteered for. Networking and listening to people has always been the one activity that sparks my interests.  

Update#2 - From 2018, I added a new section for hackathon. I think hackathons are a great way to learn fast, implement faster, and learn from mistakes of the past. A ideology that I throroughly believe in. 

At last, I am thankful for everyone who gave their feedback, shared opportunities and asked questions. Every bit of college helped me in my growth essentially. I hope this information is useful and inspiring, for people looking to contribute and expose themselves for everything that is out there and make the most of it.
